Personally, I like using the official WordPress.org themes as they always seem to look professional and clean. Moreover, they are very unlikely to contain bugs or compatibility issues that I&#8217;ve seen in the past with random themes I tried. So I recently updated my blog&#8217;s theme to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/" target="_blank">Twenty Sixteen</a> but to my surprise no header image was included (it is included in other WordPress themes). 

A quick web search for <a href="https://www.google.co.il/search?q=free+wordpress+header+images" target="_blank">free WordPress header images</a> turned out a few sites that did have some nice photos, but required you to link back to them which is a bit cumbersome. Fortunately, I realized there is a better way.

Enter <a href="http://www.freeimages.com" target="_blank">Freeimages</a>. This neat site contains almost _400,000 free images_ &#8211; many of them free even for commercial use (if you have ads on your site, it is considered commercial). For the most part, even attribution is optional (Of course, you should the license on each image to be sure).

So basically all you need to do is <a href="http://www.freeimages.com/search/landscape" target="_blank">search for some pictures</a>, pick the one you like (or several, if you&#8217;re into rotating images), make sure you abide by the license, and upload. Just be sure to download a high-res picture so that WordPress only has to crop it and/or scale it down (rather than scale it up / stretch it). If you don&#8217;t find an image to your liking in that site, <a href="https://www.google.co.il/search?q=free+stock+photos" target="_blank">there are many others</a>.

Happy cropping ðŸ˜›
