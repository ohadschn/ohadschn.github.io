I&#8217;ve previously [blogged about StreamRecorder.NET]({{ '/2010/03/streamrecorder-net/' | absolute_url }}), which is useful for recording internet radio shows. However, sometimes you want to actually _listen_ to the radio while you&#8217;re recording. You&#8217;d might also want to record tracks to _separate files_. Since StreamRecorder.NET is a front-end for other utilities, you could conceivably find a constellation that works for these cases as well. However, existing programs provide better alternatives. [Screamer Radio](https://www.screamer-radio.com/) is very nice, as is [RadioSure](http://www.radiosure.com/). However, my favorite would be a far less known program: [XMPlay](https://support.xmplay.com/). It is very minimalistic and does everything I want (I especially like its global shortcuts). Funny story, before I was aware of it I started writing a radio player of my own, based on the same library XMPlay is based on ([BASS](https://www.un4seen.com/)). You can see the result [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpradio/). Suffice to say, I&#8217;ll be sticking with XMPlay for now ðŸ™‚
