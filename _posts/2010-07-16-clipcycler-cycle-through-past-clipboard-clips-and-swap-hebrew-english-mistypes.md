Some of you may be familiar with the [clipboard cycling feature of Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa301782(VS.71).aspx), which basically stores recent clipboard items and lets you cycle through them. Personally I like this feature a lot, so I&#8217;ve created [ClipCycler](http://sourceforge.net/projects/clipcycler/) (opensource) to introduce it to all windows applications.

Simply copy text items as you would normally, they are all kept within ClipCycler. You can browse them as well as cycle forward and backwards with configurable hotkeys (e.g. Win+V)

As a bonus (mostly for Israelis), you can swap English and Hebrew characters in cases where you typed in the wrong language by mistake.

You can get ClipCycler at SourceForge:
