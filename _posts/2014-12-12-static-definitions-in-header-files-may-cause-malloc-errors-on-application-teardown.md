I recently encountered the following error in theÂ shutdown procedure of XCTest (we&#8217;re using KiwiÂ which is based on it):

> Malloc Error: pointer being freed was not allocated

Here&#8217;s how the stack looked likeÂ (truncated to section of interest):

As you can see, XCTest wasÂ executing its shutdown procedure, and during this finalization phase the destructors of static instances wereÂ executed.Â It was somewhat vexing that a static destructor would try to free up a pointer that was never allocatedÂ &#8211; after all, statics are allocated only once when the processÂ starts up. And if some static was not defined (or defined multiple times), a linker error shouldÂ have been thrown. How could this situation come to be?

Failing to answer that question armedÂ with the data above alone, I proceeded to attempt and locate the faulty string in our code. I had hoped I could spot something unusual about it,Â that wouldÂ hopefully hint me at the root cause ofÂ the failure.

The string looked innocent enough.Â However, upon finding it in our code (thankfully the literal appeared as is, and only once), I noticed it was **defined**Â (initialized) in the header. Statics should be **declared** in the header &#8211;Â never defined. Code such asÂ Â _Bar::foo = &#8220;Helvetica Neue&#8221;_ belongs in the _cpp_ file. For more information seeÂ <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/185844/initializing-private-static-members>.

And indeed, moving the definition to the _cpp_ resolved the issue. Now, the keen reader will notice that a **linker** error should have been thrown, rather than theÂ runtime exception I encountered. I&#8217;m not exactly clear on why the former wasÂ not the case, butÂ the prevailing theory entails a linker optimization that allocated only once for multiple compilation units, which backfired when the shutdown sequence triedÂ to free all occurrences separately (or one occurrence that happened to not beÂ the one thatÂ was initialized).

If you have a better explanation, I&#8217;ll be happy to hear it.
  
In the meantime, mind your statics ðŸ™‚
