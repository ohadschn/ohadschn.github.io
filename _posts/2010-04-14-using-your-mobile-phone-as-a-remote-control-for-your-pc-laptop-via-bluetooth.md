I was looking for a free utility to do this, and after some googling I bumped into [JM2PC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jm2pc/).

Following the instructions in its Readme.TXT file, you can have your mobile remote control up and running within minutes, so I definitely recommend it.

Another interesting freebie is [MobileWitch](http://www.mobilewitch.com/Mobilewitch-Bluetooth-Remote-Control_software_details_2.htm), which at first glance seems similar, so you might want to check it out as well.

If you&#8217;re willing to pay (I&#8217;m not a great believer of paid software), [Vectir](http://www.vectir.com) might be what you&#8217;re after.
