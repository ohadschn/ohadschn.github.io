Ever wonder how long it would take you to complete your entire Steam library? I know I did about 10 months ago. Alas, the only site that would answer me at that time, <a href="http://natecollings.com/" target="_blank">Nate Collings</a>&#8216; cool <a href="https://steamplaytime.appspot.com/" target="_blank">SteamPlaytime</a>, has closed up shop. 

**CHALLENGE ACCEPTED**.

After many weekends and vacations of hard work, I present to you <a href="https://www.howlongtobeatsteam.com/?utm_source=OhadSoft&#038;utm_medium=blog&#038;utm_campaign=OhadSoftAnnouncement" target="_blank">HowLongToBeatSteam.com</a>:

[![HowLongtoBeatSteam]({{ page.hltbs_image | absolute_url }})]({{ page.hltbs_image | absolute_url }})

Features

  * Examine your total current and remaining playtimes in the different <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/" target="_blank">HowLongToBeat</a> completion levels (Main, Extras, Completionist).
  * Slice and filter playtime by name, genre and [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/) score.
  * Include and exclude specific games in the calculation.
  * Examine your full playtime table and sort by current playtime and time to beat.
  * You can even check out an imaginary profile containing all of Steam&#8217;s games (currently over 9,000!)

Enjoy ðŸ™‚
