Ever wonder how long it would take you to complete your entire Steam library? I know I did about 10 months ago. Alas, the only site that would answer me at that time, <a href="http://natecollings.com/" target="_blank">Nate Collings</a>&#8216; cool <a href="http://steamplaytime.appspot.com/" target="_blank">SteamPlaytime</a>, has closed up shop. 

**CHALLENGE ACCEPTED**.
