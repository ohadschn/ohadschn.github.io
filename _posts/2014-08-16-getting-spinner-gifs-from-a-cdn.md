Using animated gifs for spinner / loader animation can be quite convenient, and sites such as [AjaxLoad](http://ajaxload.info/)Â allow you to createÂ them to your liking. However,Â being the early optimization evil person that I am, I was wondering if I could get those offÂ a [CDN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network). There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any official support for this, and you won&#8217;t get custom taliored gifs to your exact liking, but a [sneakyÂ web](https://www.google.com/search?q=site:cdnjs.com+gif)Â search reveals quite a few possibilities. For example:

<a href="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/0.16.1/images/loader-large.gif" rel="lightbox[387]">http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/semantic-ui/0.16.1/images/loader-large.gif</a>

<img class="alignnone" src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fancybox/2.1.5/fancybox_loading.gif" alt="" width="24" height="24" />

<img class="alignnone" src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/galleriffic/2.0.1/css/loader.gif" alt="" width="48" height="48" />
