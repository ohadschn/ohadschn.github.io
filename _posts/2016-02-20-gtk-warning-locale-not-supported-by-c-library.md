I was recently writing a mono application for OSX inÂ MonoDevelop, using [Gtk#](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/gui/gtksharp/)Â as the GUI framework. The app seemed to workÂ fine, but it would throw the following error each time it started:

<pre class="brush: plain; title: ; notranslate" title="">Gtk-WARNING **: Locale not supported by C library</pre>

Since I don&#8217;t like errors, even if I don&#8217;t understand their immediate effect, I did a bit of searching. My search led me to this [StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7165108/in-osx-lion-lang-is-not-set-to-utf8-how-fix),Â whose answers suggestedÂ defining theÂ following environmentÂ variables in the terminal:

```bash
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

Indeed, setting those variables in a bash script, prior to the execution of my application, resolved the issue ðŸ™‚
