A couple of months ago I blogged about [TvGameLauncher](http://ohadsc.wordpress.com/2014/01/12/introducing-tvgamelauncher/), a command line tool to help you launch your favorite games on your HDMI-connected TV (or any other connected display) with all the necessaryÂ steps carried out for you (change primary display, change default audio endpoint,Â preventÂ sleep).

The tool works great (at least for me ðŸ™‚ ), butÂ its command-line nature leaves is inaccessible toÂ users who aren&#8217;t comfortable with the command line and the entire experience isn&#8217;t that much fun.

EnterÂ [TvGameLauncherGUI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tvgamelauncher/). I&#8217;ve created a nice(?) WPF GUI front-end for TvGameLauncher, and alsoÂ improved theÂ latter for good measure:

  1. There is now a useful &#8220;darken non-primary displays&#8221; that will darken all displaysÂ except the one where the game takes place for improved gaming immersion atmosphere.
  2. TvGameLauncher now employs the excellent [NirCmd](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)Â instead of the previous relatively unknown (and less reliable and updated) tools.
  3. Improved logging, error handling, and more.

Get it atÂ [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tvgamelauncher/), and be sure to check outÂ theÂ 5 minute tutorial onÂ [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8N5RPswlH0).
