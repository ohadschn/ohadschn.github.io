As far as I know, the most robust, free solutions for recording streams of all types today are MPlayer and VLC. Both require some command line arguments which, for many users, would be difficult to use (and find!). In addition, they do not cater to many streaming needs. For that reason, I created StreamRecorder.NET &#8211; a free, open source windows GUI front end for several programs (most notably MPayer and VLC), that provides the following features:

  * Records, joins and post processes stream using the tools you choose &#8211; recommended defaults are supplied
  * Full Command Line Interface (CLI) allowing scheduling and automation
  * Keeps the recording process alive (restarting when necessary)
  * Time stamps file names to avoid overwrites
  * Logs recorder output to file
  * MP3 and Windows Media easy presets
  * Complete Tool tip coverage explaining all functionality

Enjoy !
